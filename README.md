Written in TS. To run, first optionally install with `npm i`, then run `npx ts-node <day>/<day>.ts`, with an optional argument `part1` or `part2` to run individual parts for days. Example: `npx ts-node 2/2.ts part2` to run only part 2 of day 2.

Possible alternative answers can be found in the folders and will be named as `<day>_<attempt>.ts`.
